# 2D/3D SPH Particle Simulation

This project demonstrates a simple 2D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation using WGSL, and some GLSL (as i switched mid-project), and Rust. The simulation models the behavior of particles under fluid dynamics, providing visualizations and interactions with a GPU-based approach. ( don't mind how messy it is, it's still work in progress :D )

## Features

- GPU-accelerated particle simulation.
- Real-time visualization of particle movements.
- Adjustable simulation parameters such as smoothing radius, gravity, and target density.
- Multi-pass computation for accurate particle interaction.
